NETWORKING
* LAYERS. Why? Reduce Complexity and Improve Fleixibility
	7. Application (HTTP, DNS): Web server, browser, mail, game
		- OSI Model includes 6. Presentation and 5. Session, but often are implemented as part of Application Layer	
		- This layer with session and connection coordination.
		- This layer provides application services for file transfers, e-mail, and other network software services
	4. Transport (TCP, UDP): TCP
		- This layer provides transparent transfer of data between end systems, or hosts, and is responsible for end-to-end error recovery and flow control. It ensures complete data transfer. 
	3. Network (IP): - Packets
		-  This layer provides switching and routing technologies, creating logical paths, known as virtual circuits, for transmitting data from node to node. 
	2. Data link (Ethernet): hardware/firmware/drivers - Frames
		- At this layer, data packets are encoded and decoded into bits. It furnishes transmission protocol knowledge and management and handles errors in the physical layer, flow control and frame synchronization. 
	1. Physical (optical, copper, radio) - Physical Structure
		- This layer conveys the bit stream - electrical impulse, light or radio signal â€” through the network at the electrical and mechanical level.

	- All layers must exist at host: Bits arrive on wire, must make it up to application.
	- 4. The network does not support reliable delivery --> Transport layer (and above) not supported

* WORKFLOW
1. Bits arrive on wire --> Physical layer (L1)
2. Packets must be delivered across links and local networks --> Datalink layer (L2)
3. Packets must be delivered between networks for global delivery --> Network layer (L3)


* PROTOCOL : An agreement between parties on how to communicate.
	- Encapsulation Protocol Headers
	
* end-2-end principle
- Some application requirements can only be correctly implemented end-to-end (reliability, security, etc.) --> @ Hosts
- Implementing these in the network is hard (every step along the way must be fail proof)
	- switches: implement physical and datalink layers(L1,L2)
	- routers: implement physical, datalink, network layers (L1, L2,L3)
